# HIGH PRIORITY

- BUGS:
- issue descriptions not showing
- FEATURES:
- pricing page
  - see jira and other competitors
    - explore payment providers (stripe is the only one i know)
- real logo

# LOW PRIORITY

- dedicated /register route (currently login/register are combined on /login)
- issues
  - assignee "note" for extra context on their role in the task
  - deadline
- user preferences
  - colour scheme
  - "assign to me by default" option for new issues
- import existing jira data
- git integration
  - issue fields:
    - branch
    - commits
    - pull request (github/gitlab/bitbucket)
    - view:
      - open git diff in a new tab
- figure out if it's possible to remove the "lib/server/..." helpers altogether, and have some sort of dynamic route maker in the shared package
- request logging
